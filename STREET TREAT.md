# **STREET TREAT**


## Problem Statement : 

The amount of time schools allocate for lunch can be just as important as the food they serve—and the 25 minutes to 50 minutes the typical school sets aside is often too short, say the School Nutrition Association and an expert who has studied the issue.

By the time students walk to the cafeteria, maybe run to the bathroom, and wait in line for their food, they often don’t have enough time to eat all of their meal—especially the healthy, more fibrous parts—which can have long-lasting effects on their academic performance and behaviour. Adding to that, if students have pending assignment, making projects or get a call from their professors, this time gets further deducted.

And low-income students who rely on school-provided meals can be especially affected by rushed lunch periods because of the time they spend in line waiting to be served.


## Proposed Solution : 

To save time, students can just order food on the app, the app returns the time for the order to get ready. After that amount of time student can go and receive his/her order. If students do not like the college food, they can explore other places sitting at a place and have different tastes around him/her. Furthermore, student can also choose from other shops, big or small, to choose food according to their preference. If you get to know your friend’s birthday at the last minute, just scroll and order and the party is lit!!

Another advantage of this app is it will show all the shops registered with the app, which can be small business as well. This will help support and promote small stalls and shops along with big or standard restaurants.

## Functionality & Concept :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface that helps the user to order food from local shops without having to wait in long queues. Following are a few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the app:

Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

Dark and Light Mode : This app can automatically adopt to light or dark mode as required for better display and interaction with the user. 

Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for Users to move around and explore the app. Apps also use App Navigation to move from ordering food to getting the recipt.The app contains numerous images and different colours so that the user can understand the content better and choose what they like.

Recycler-View: To go back to the user menu and keep searching back and forth until user is sure about what to order and clicks the confirm button.
 
 There is further scope to of making the app map based to that the user can access all the registered shop of a particular area and choose from them.
